        <h1>Technical Writing Portfolio</h1>
        <p>ENG 313 is a technical writing course at Miami University. In this course I learned and mastered skills to writing reader-centered
        works. I was able to determine a specific audience and customize my writing to their needs and create the most effective arguments.</p>
        <h2><a href="http://www.emmajeanbelanger.com/technical-writing-docs/Resume.pdf">Resume</a> & 
          <a href="http://www.emmajeanbelanger.com/technical-writing-docs/LetterofApplication.pdf">Cover Letter</a></h2>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to create a resume and letter of application that was customed designed for a specific job
        listing. The audience was the employer, which in this case was a hiring manager at Google for an entry level software
        engineering. </p>
        <h2><a href="http://www.emmajeanbelanger.com/technical-writing-docs/instructions.pdf">Instructions</a></h2>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to create a set of instructions using reader-centered writing approaches. 
          My set of instructions instructs readers with a basic computer science background how to create their first project on Github.
          It uses persuasive techniques to keep the reader engaged and highlights the practical use of storing their projects on Github.</p>
        <h2><a href="http://www.emmajeanbelanger.com/technical-writing-docs/ENG313_Report.pdf">Report</a></h2>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to work in a team of 3 people to create a long report. My team and I wrote an in-depth
          report that offered and recommended alternatives to help Miami University increase the number of women in their engineering
          department. Out report demonstrates my understanding of using text and graphics together to create an engaging, informational
          report to present to the Dean of the College of Engineering and Computing and University officials.</p>
