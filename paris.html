        <h1>Paris - Summer 2015</h1>
        <p>I spent the Summer of 2015 in Paris, France where I learned about design and culture. This 5-week program immersed me
        in Parisian culture while I took courses in design principles by Miami University faculty. I covered several major topics during
        my time there: design principles relating to graphic design, music, and architecture.</p>
        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>One of the projects I completed during this program was creating a soundscape based off a poem or work of writing.
          The goal of this soundscape was to capture Scott Fitzgerald’s interpretation of a summer storm. I successful created a piece 
          that captures the playfulness yet daunting idea of a summer storm. Through this I mastered the art of using technology to 
          create a cohesive work of music inpsired by creative writing.</p>

        <p>  Original Text: Summer Storm by F. Scott Fitzgerald (parts of text used) <blockquote>
  Faint winds, and a song fading and leaves falling,<br />
  Faint winds, and far away a fading laughter . . .<br />
  And the rain and over the fields a voice calling . . .<br />
  Wait for the mists and for the blacker rain–<br />
  Heavier winds that stir the veil of fate,<br />
  Happier winds that pile her hair;<br />
  Tears from her wetted breast the splattered blouse<br />
  Of day, glides down the dreaming hills, tear-bright,<br />
  To cover with her hair the eerie green . . .<br />
  Love for the dusk . . . Love for the glistening after;<br />
  Quiet the trees to their last tops . . . serene . . .<br />
  Faint winds, and far away a fading laughter . . .</blockquote>
