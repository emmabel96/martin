        <h1>Humanitarian Work</h1>
        <p>Inspired by social issues, I strive to make the world a better place for everyone. In doing so, I'm involved in many
          organizations and volunteer my time and talents to those who need them the most.</p>
        <img src="http://www.emmajeanbelanger.com/images/habitat.jpg" alt="Habitat for Humanity work" width="400">
        <h2><a href="http://www.peacejusticestudies.org/">Peace and Justice Studies Association</a></h2>
        <p>Inspired by an outstanding social justice professor, I joined a small research team at Miami University where I helped
        with the maintainance of the PJSA website. The Peace and Justice Reasearch Association (PJSA) is an affiliate of the International
        Peace Research Association that brings together academics, teachers, and grassroots activists to explore alternatives 
          to violence and share visions and strategies for peacebuilding, social justice, and social change. </p>
        <h2><a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a> & <a href="https://women.acm.org/">ACM-W</a></h2>
        <p><i>"By 2020, there will be 1.4 million jobs available in computing related fields. US graduates are on track to fill 29% of those 
          jobs. Women are on track to fill just 3%." -<a href="https://girlswhocode.com/about-us/#the-problem">www.girlswhocode.com</a></i></p>
        <p>This startling statistic poses a major social problem now and in the future. Women are already severly underepresented in the
        technology industry and organizations like Girls Who Code aim to solve this problem. Being a part of such an influential organization,
        I have had the opportunity to volunteer at Miami University's Girls Who Code club where I teach girls and boys from 5th-12th grade
        to code in an inclusive environment.</p>
        <p>Inspired by the girls we work with and the club's amazing volunteers, a friend and I decided to follow this support through to
          the college level where we founded an ACM-W chapter at Miami University. The Association for Computing Machinery - Women's is a 
          national organization that celebrates, informs, and supports women in computing fields. Being the President of this new club, I've
          helped to create an environment at Miami University for all genders and majors that support and further the development of women
          in computing.</p>
        <h2><a href="https://www.apo.org/aboutus">Alpha Phi Omega</a></h2>
        <p>Alpha Phi Omega is a national co-ed service fraternity. After joining in the Spring of 2015, I committed to 
        completing over 20 hours of service to my semester on campus, in my Oxford community, to the nation, and to the fraternity
        while promoting leadership, service, and friendship.</p>
